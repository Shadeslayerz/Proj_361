 * This package contains the networking demo code.
 * Note that it requires that the Hello and GameState (for the circle demo) 
 * packets are implemented. It is suggested that this package is removed
 * once the Battleships game development starts and the networking component
 * is modified along with the implemented packets as this demo will be obsolete.
